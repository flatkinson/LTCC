[3H]Nitrendipine binding affinity and coronary vasodilating activity of these compounds were evaluated. The absolute configuration of the most potent enantiomer (3a) with the longest duration was unequivocally determined to be (S)-1,4-dihydropyridine-C4 and (S)-pyrrolidine-C3 (S,S) by X-ray crystallographic study on 3a X HBr as well as 3a X HCl. The configuration of 1a corresponds to R, and the other enantiomers of 3 were respectively determined by chemical correlation. The potency order of the four enantiomers was (S,S)-3a greater than (S,R)-3b greater than (R,R)-3d greater than (R,S)-3c. Latent chiral characters of nifedipine derivatives with the identical ester groups were assigned by comparison of their puckering modes of 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) rings with those found in 3a X HCl or 3a X HBr. On the basis of the assignment, it has been revealed that the (S)-DHP nifedipine derivatives possess the synperiplanar carbonyl group at C5. The conformational restriction may be a factor causing stereoselectivity of antagonism.</td>\n",

       "      <td>2,5-Dihydro-4-methyl-2-phenyl-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic acid esters, based on the structures of dihydropyridines and diltiazem, were synthesized from o-aminothiophenol and 2-(phenylmethylene)- 3-oxobutanoic acid esters. Biological evaluation in the potassium-depolarized rabbit aorta suggests that these compounds are calcium channel blockers. The in vitro activity was further confirmed by electrophysiological techniques. Structure-activity studies for the aromatic substitution showed that the 2-nitro derivative was the most potent (IC50 = 0.3 microM) compound in vitro while the ethyl ester was slightly better than the corresponding methyl ester. Replacement of sulfur with nitrogen atom provided 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl-2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, which was only slightly less active than the corresponding benzothiazepine. Derivatization of the nitrogen in 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl- 2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester with a (dimethylamino)ethyl group (present in diltiazem) provided 2,5-dihydro-5-[(dimethylamino)ethyl]- 4-methyl-2-(3-nitrophenyl)-1,5-benzo-thiazepine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester, which was found to be equipotent to diltiazem in vitro. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]nitrendipine and [3H]diltiazem showed that the compound with the free nitrogen binds competitively into the dihydropyridine binding site while the molecule in which the nitrogen is alkylated with a (dimethylamino)ethyl group interacts competitively with both diltiazem and dihydropyridine binding sites. Our results therefore show that 2,5-dihydro-4-methyl-2-phenyl-1,5-benzothiazepine-3-carboxylic ester is a good starting point for designing dihydropyridine as well as diltiazem mimics.</td>\n",

Comparisons of structure are presented to previously analyzed 1,4-dihydropyridines. The degree of 1,4-dihydropyridine ring puckering is dependent on the nature and position of the phenyl ring substituent and the adopted interring conformation. Different ester substituents affect 1,4-dihydropyridine ring puckering to a small extent in most cases. Pharmacologic and radioligand binding activities for the nine compounds studied show a parallel dependence on phenyl ring substituent, but the compounds are approximately 10-fold more active in the radioligand binding assay than in the pharmacologic assay. Consistent with a previous report for the nifedipine series (Fossheim et al. J. Med.

These derivatives were prepared by using the Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis. The assignment of structure was based on spectroscopic data and a regiochemically unambiguous synthesis. Several of the analogues inhibited [3H]nitrendipine binding with IC50 values as low as 25 nM. By comparison, nifedipine, a clinically useful 1,4-dihydropyridine CCB, inhibits [3H]nitrendipine binding with an IC50 of 1.6 nM. In the Langendorff rat heart preparation, treatment with the more potent derivatives produced marked dose-related increases in coronary flow with little or no effect on heart rate or contractility, except at the highest concentrations tested. The selectivity for vascular versus cardiac effects was similar to that of nifedipine, i.e., the concentration producing vasodilation was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration eliciting cardiodepression. These novel isomers extend the structure-activity relationships for calcium channel blockers into a series closely related to the 1,4-dihydropyridines.</td>\n",

The highest biological activity was observed for 5-alkyl-3-phenyl-IDHP (1), for which the O-endo conformation at the ring juncture between the heterocyclic rings is known in the solid state. The 3,5-dialkyl-IDHPs were intermediate in overall activity. A theoretical study of rotation about this ring juncture was performed to estimate the relative energy and barrier to rotation for the different conformers as a function of both the ring juncture between the heterocyclic rings and the esters in the 3- and 5-position of the dihydropyridine. Molecular mechanics predicts the minimum energy conformer to be O-exo-ap,ap, while quantum mechanical calculations predict O-exo-sp,sp as the minimum-energy conformer. Both methods indicate that the barrier to rotation about the heterocyclic ring juncture should be relative low, but both methods appear to overestimate the difficulty of ester rotation. A single-crystal X-ray diffractometry study of the (3,5-dimethylisoxazolyl)dihydropyridine 2 was carried out, and shows the O-endo ring juncture and sp,sp ester conformation. 2D NOESY NMR spectroscopy indicates the presence of both conformations about the ring juncture, at room temperature, as evidenced by correlations for both alkyl groups on the isoxazole with the C-2 methyl on the DHP moiety. The ap ester conformer was also evidenced by NOESY, indicating that ester interconversion must take place.</td>\n",

A prerequisite for calcium channel blocking activity in vitro and in vivo is the presence of two pharmacophores: a 4'-aryl methyl ether and a basic substituent appended to N1 with a pKa in the physiological range. When these constraints are satisfied, a wide variety of substitution is tolerated at C6, C7, and C3. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group at C6 appears to enhance potency in vitro and in vivo. For such benzazepinones, activity is primarily dependent upon lipophilicity, as measured by log P. We believe these compounds must partition into the cell membrane in order to access their receptor. The quaternary methiodide 15k was used to demonstrate that the binding site for benzazepinones is on the intracellular face of the membrane.

Structure-activity relationships were evaluated where PAF antagonist activity was measured in vitro by determining the concentration of compound (IC50) required to inhibit the PAF-induced aggregation of rabbit washed platelets, and in vivo by determining the oral dose (ED50) which protected mice from a lethal injection of PAF. The nature of the substituent at the dihydropyridine 2-position was found to be important for both in vitro and in vivo activity, whereas there was greater flexibility for structural variation at the 4- and 5-positions. The most potent compound was 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-6-methyl-2-[4-(2- methylimidazo[4,5-c]pyrid-1-yl)phenyl]-5-[N-(2- pyridyl)carbamoyl]pyridine (17, UK-74,505), IC50 = 4.3 nM, ED50 = 0.26 mg/kg po, which was found to be approximately 33 times more potent in vitro (rabbit platelet aggregation) and about 8 times more potent in vivo (murine lethality) than WEB2086. Compound 17 also exhibited a long duration of action in the dog (inhibition of PAF-induced whole blood aggregation ex vivo was maintained for greater than 24 h following a single oral dose of 75 micrograms/kg) and was highly selective as a PAF antagonist, showing only weak affinity (IC50 = 6600 nM) for the [3H]nitrendipine binding site.

In blocking Ca(2+)-evoked contractions of K(+)-depolarized rabbit aortic strips, compounds 12 and 41 were 10-fold more potent than nifedipine; 27 other compounds were 1-4-fold more potent. Their vascular versus cardiac selectivity was very pronounced; for instance, the selectivity index for compound 41 was 70-fold higher than that of nifedipine. This was also true for the vasoconstricting compound 22, which was as potent as Bay K 8644 in enhancing the Ca(2+)-evoked contractions of rabbit aorta strips, yet it had poor inotropic activity in rabbit left atria. Oral administration of compounds 38, 40, 43, and 53 (20 mg/kg) caused a 35-37% decrease in systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR); these effects were similar to those of nifedipine. However, iv administration of these compounds to anesthetized SHR caused a decrease in blood pressure which was more pronounced and long-lasting than that of nifedipine. When administered iv at 100 micrograms/kg, the vasoconstricting compound 22 caused a 40% increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Compound 22 exhibited an unusually interesting feature over the other five Ca2+ DHP agonists: it had diester substitutions at the C-3 and C-5 positions of the DHP ring. Overall, compounds possessing these properties might be useful in treating clinical cardiovascular conditions in which DHP Ca2+ antagonists or agonists are indicated.</td>\n",

Receptor binding studies show that all compounds display a high affinity for the 5-HT3 receptors. In both series annelation results in compounds being 7 and 4 times more potent than the references ondansetron and GR 65,630, respectively. Similar to ondansetron, the 1,7-annelated indoles show little stereoselectivity. The (-)-isomers are only slightly more potent than the (+)-isomers. The receptor binding profile of l-10-[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-5,6,8,9,10,11-hexahydro-4H-pyri do [3,2,1-jk]carbazol-11-one hydrochloride (24b) (INN cilansetron) shows that the compound displays, besides a high affinity for 5-HT3 receptors (Ki = 0.19 nM), a weak affinity for sigma-receptors (Ki = 340 nM), muscarine M1 receptors (Ki = 910 nM), and 5-HT4 receptors (Ki = 960 nM) and no affinity (Ki > or = 5000 nM) for all the other receptor types tested (n = 37). The new compounds fit the proposed necessary chemical template for binding: a heteroaromatic ring system, a coplanar carbonyl group, and a nitrogen center at well-defined distances. The enhanced potency of the annelated 1,7-indole derivatives indicates that the extra ring provides a favorable hydrophobic area for interaction with the 5-HT3 receptor site. In vivo cilansetron is more potent and induces less central side effects than ondansetron. At present cilansetron is in clinical trials.</td>\n",

The compounds are verapamil analogues with restricted molecular flexibility designed to gather information on the active conformation(s) of the parent drug. The relative stereochemistry of the four racemates was established by X-ray crystallography and by 1H NMR spectroscopy; conformational analysis was supported by theoretical calculations. Negative inotropic and chronotropic activities were evaluated on guinea pig atria, while vasodilatory activity on smooth muscle was tested on guinea pig aortic strips. Binding studies on cat ventricles were performed using (-)-[N-methyl-3H]desmethoxyverapamil (D888) as a reference ligand.

These compounds, related to diltiazem, have been shown to be representative of a novel series of calcium channel antagonists. The IC50S for inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding calculated by radioreceptor assay on rat cortex and rat heart homogenates showed that some of the described compounds possess an affinity equal to or higher than those of the reference calcium antagonists verapamil and cis-(+)-diltiazem. Furthermore, the alteration of the benzothiazepinone system of diltiazem to the pyrrolo[1,4]benzothiazine system of the title compounds resulted in a clear-cut selectivity for cardiac over vascular tissue, as shown in functional studies. In fact comparison of calcium antagonist activity on guinea pig aorta strips with the negative inotropic activity, determined by using an isolated guinea pig left atrium, revealed that the compounds examined displayed higher selectivity than the reference standard, within a wide variation of data. A number of structure-activity relationship trends have been identified, and possible explanation is advanced in order to account for the observed differences in selectivity. Prerequisite for in vitro calcium channel-blocking activity is the presence of two pharmacophores, namely, the substitution at C-4 and the substitution on the pyrrole ring. Two of the tested compounds, 8b and 28a, were identified as potent calcium antagonists selective for cardiac over vascular tissue.</td>\n",

Our results confirm and firmly establish a preference for syn-orientation of an unsymmetrically substituted aryl moiety at the DHP receptor (15d vs 15e). We propose a normal vs capsized DHP boat model to explain structural and conformational requirements for modulation of calcium channel function that requires an obligatory left-hand side alkoxy cis-carbonyl interaction for maximal DHP receptor affinity, the effect of channel function being determined by orientation of the 4-aryl group. Enantiomers having an up-oriented pseudoaxial aryl group (normal DHP boat) will elicit calcium antagonist activity, whereas enantiomers having a down-oriented pseudoaxial aryl group (capsized DHP boat) will elicit calcium agonist activity. Single enantiomers of macrocyclic lactone 15b demonstrate opposite channel activity. Antagonist activity resides in enantiomer 15b-A (S-configuration, left-hand side alkoxy cis-carbonyl with up-oriented pseudoaxial aryl group and normal DHP boat), whereas agonist activity resides in enantiomer 15b-B (R-configuration, left-hand side alkoxy cis-carbonyl with down-oriented pseudoaxial aryl group and capsized DHP boat). Moreover, this model is consistent with and provides a rational explanation of previous literature in this area, most notably the observation of chiral inversion and potency diminution upon replacement of ester by hydrogen in the Bay K 8644 series.</td>\n",

Therefore, several 7-(acyloxy)-6-arylpyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepines, potent and selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligands recently developed by us (3, 7-20), were subjected to calcium channel receptor binding assay. Some of these compounds showed an unexpected potency in displacing the binding of [3H]nitrendipine from L-type calcium channels, much higher than that reported for PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 and equal to or higher than that of reference calcium antagonists such as verapamil and (+)-cis-diltiazem. Specifically, in rat cortex homogenate, our prototypic PBR ligand 7-acetoxy-6-(p-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine (3) showed an IC50 equal to 0.13 nM for inhibition of [3H]nitrendipine binding. Furthermore, in functional studies this compound displayed a clear-cut selectivity for cardiac over vascular tissue. Comparison of calcium antagonist activity on guinea pig aorta strips with the negative inotropic activity, determined by using isolated guinea pig left atria, revealed that 3 displayed higher selectivity than the reference (+)-cis-diltiazem. Thus, the pyrrolobenzothiazepine 3 might represent a new tool for characterizing the relationship between the PBR and cardiac function. Furthermore, we have also investigated the structural dependence of binding to PBR and L-type calcium channels, and this study allowed us to identify a new class of potent calcium channel blockers selective for cardiac over vascular tissue, with no affinity for PBR. A number of structure-activity relationship trends have been identified, and a possible explanation is advanced in order to account for the observed differences in selectivity. Three structural features, namely, (i) the saturation of the C(6)-C(7) double bond, with a consequent higher molecular flexibility, (ii) the presence of a substituent in the benzofused ring, and (iii) a basic side chain at C-10 of the pyrrolobenzothiazepine ring system, were found to be responsible for potent L-type calcium channel antagonism and clear-cut selectivity for cardiac over vascular tissue. Among the synthesized compounds the pyrrolobenzothiazepine 62 was found to be the most promising selective calcium channel blocker. Additionally, the molecular structure determination of the key intermediate 48 by X-ray diffraction, molecular modeling, and NMR analysis is reported.</td>\n",

       "      <td>1,4-Dihydropyridine and pyridine derivatives bound to three subtypes of adenosine receptors in the micromolar range. Affinity was determined in radioligand binding assays at rat brain A1 and A2A receptors using [3H]-(R)-PIA [[3H]-(R)-N6-(phenylisopropyl)adenosine] and [3H]CGS 21680 [[3H]-2-[[4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl]ethylamino]-5'-(N-ethylcarbamoyl++ +) adenosine], respectively. Affinity was determined at cloned human and rat A3 receptors using [125I]AB-MECA [N6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-5'-(N-methylcarbamoyl)adenosine]. Structure-activity analysis at adenosine receptors indicated that sterically bulky groups at the 4-, 5-, and 6-positions are tolerated. (R,S)-Nicardipine, 12, displayed Ki values of 19.6 and 63.8 microM at rat A1 and A2A receptors, respectively, and 3.25 microM at human A3 receptors. Similarly, (R)-niguldipine, 14, displayed Ki values of 41.3 and 1.90 microM at A1 and A3 receptors, respectively, and was inactive at A2A receptors. A preference for the R- vs the S-enantiomer was observed for several dihydropyridines at adenosine receptors, in contrast with the selectivity at L-type Ca2+ channels. A 4-trans-beta-styryl derivative, 24, with a Ki value of 0.670 microM at A3 receptors, was 24-fold selective vs A1 receptors (Ki = 16.1 microM) and 74-fold vs A2A receptors (Ki = 49.3 microM). The affinity of 24 at L-type Ca2+ channels, measured in rat brain membranes using [3H]isradipine, indicated a Ki value of 0.694 microM, and the compound is thus nonselective between A3 receptors and L-type Ca2+ channels. Inclusion of a 6-phenyl group enhanced A3 receptor selectivity: Compound 28 (MRS1097; 3,5-diethyl 2-methyl-6-phenyl-4-(trans-2-phenylvinyl)-1,4(R,S)-dihydro-pyridin e-3, 5-dicarboxylate) was 55-fold selective vs A1 receptors, 44-fold selective vs A2A receptors, and over 1000-fold selective vs L-type Ca2+ channels. In addition, compound 28 attenuated the A3 agonist-elicited inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, whereas nicardipine, 12, displaced radioligand from the Na(+)-independent adenosine transporter with an apparent affinity of 5.36 +/- 1.51 microM, compound 28 displaced less than 10% of total binding at a concentration of 100 microM. Pyridine derivatives, when bearing a 4-alkyl but not a 4-phenyl group, maintained affinity for adenosine receptors. These findings indicate that the dihydropyridines may provide leads for the development of novel, selective A3 adenosine antagonists.</td>\n",

The fact that active compounds increase adriamycin accumulation in the resistant KB-A1 cells, and not in the sensitive KB-3-1 cells, suggests they act predominantly by inhibiting the P-glycoprotein-catalyzed efflux of cytotoxic agents. No direct relation was found between the affinity for the phenylalkylamine binding site of the calcium channel and in vitro sensitization of resistant cells. In vivo, when administered po in association with vincristine (0.25 mg/kg), five compounds (3, 4, 9, 25, and 26), of very differing calcium channel affinities (Ki from 5 to 560 nM), fully restored (T/V > or = 1.4) the sensitivity of P388/VCR leukemia to vincristine.</td>\n",

Due to the lack of experimental structural data on these derivatives, the minimum energy conformers obtained by molecular mechanics calculations were used in the subsequent study. Structures were aligned following an alignment criterion based on the pharmacophoric groups of the studied compounds. The predictive ability of the CoMFA model was evaluated using a test set consisting of three representative compounds. The best 3D-quantitative structure-activity relationship model found yields significant cross-validated, conventional, and predictive r2 values equal to 0.703, 0.970, and 0.865, respectively, the average absolute error of predictions being 0.26 log unit. The predictive capability of this model was also tested on a further test set of molecules consisting of diltiazem and nine pyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepines endowed with calcium antagonist activity. The accurate results obtained also in this case revealed the robustness of the model. On the basis of the same alignment, the structural moieties of the studied calcium entry blockers which are thought to contribute to the biological activity were identified, and a possible receptor-binding site for all these compounds is presented taking into account the information derived from the analysis of the steric and electrostatic CoMFA contour maps.</td>\n",

EC50calcd values for derivatives containing NO-donor moieties, expression of the Ca2+-blocking component of their vasodilator activity, were interpolated on this linear regression. They showed a good correspondence with EC50iGC values determined in the presence of soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors. Analysis of EC50iGC/EC50 ratios provided a useful tool to distinguish well-balanced hybrids from derivatives biased toward Ca2+-blocking or NO-dependent vasodilator activity.

The investigated compounds originate from fluorinated 4-aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines, which are known calcium channel blockers, and/or from fluorinated analogues of pinacidil, which is an opener of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. In particular, we studied the most potent hybrid, 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-dicarbomethoxy-4-(2-difluoromethoxy-5-N-(N' '-cyano-N'-1,2,2-trimethyl-propylguanidyl)-phenyl)-1, 4-dihydropyridine (4a), together with its parent compounds, the dihydropyridine 1b and the pinacidil analogue 3. In isolated rat mesenteric arteries, micromolar concentrations of 4a relaxed contractions exerted by K(+)-depolarization or by norepinephrine. The latter effect was sensitive to the potassium channel blocker glibenclamide. Micromolar 4a also inhibited [(3)H](+)-isradipine and [(3)H]P1075 binding to rat cardiac membranes, and it blocked L-type calcium channels expressed in a mammalian cell line. The respective parent compounds 1b and 3 were always more potent and more selective regarding calcium channel or potassium channel interaction, respectively. In contrast, 4a combined both effects within the same concentration range, indicating that it may represent a lead structure for a novel class of pharmacological hybrid compounds.</td>\n",

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

We found that the hydroxyl function in the 4'-position is crucial for improving the sodium channel blocking properties. Moreover, the stereochemistry and the topology of the N-linked side chain also influence this interaction. Indeed, the affinity is improved by an aromatic substitution in the side chain. By modifying the N substituent and the substitution pattern of the hydroxyl function, we were able to discover (2R)-[2alpha,3(S),6alpha]-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydro-6,11,11-tri-methyl-3-[2-(phenylmethoxy)propyl]-2,6-methano-3-benzazocin-10-ol hydrochloride.

       "      <td>L-type Ca(2+) channels in mammalian brain neurons have either a Ca(V)1.2 or Ca(V)1.3 pore-forming subunit. Recently, it was shown that Ca(V)1.3 Ca(2+) channels underlie autonomous pacemaking in adult dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and this reliance renders them sensitive to toxins used to create animal models of Parkinson's disease. Antagonism of these channels with the dihydropyridine antihypertensive drug isradipine diminishes the reliance on Ca(2+) and the sensitivity of these neurons to toxins, pointing to a potential neuroprotective strategy. However, for neuroprotection without an antihypertensive side effect, selective Ca(V)1.3 channel antagonists are required. In an attempt to identify potent and selective antagonists of Ca(V)1.3 channels, 124 dihydropyridines (4-substituted-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic diesters) were synthesized. The antagonism of heterologously expressed Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)1.3 channels was then tested using electrophysiological approaches and the FLIPR Calcium 4 assay. Despite the large diversity in substitution on the dihydropyridine scaffold, the most Ca(V)1.3 selectivity was only about twofold. These results support a highly similar dihydropyridine binding site at both Ca(V)1.2 and Ca(V)1.3 channels and suggests that other classes of compounds need to be identified for Ca(V)1.3 selectivity.</td>\n",

This mutation led to hyperactivation of JAK2, cytokine-independent signaling, and subsequent activation of downstream signaling networks. The genetic, biological, and physiological evidence suggests that JAK2 inhibitors could be effective in treating MPDs. De novo design efforts of new scaffolds identified 1-amino-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indol-4-carboxamides as a new viable lead series. Subsequent optimization of cell potency, metabolic stability, and off-target activities of the leads led to the discovery of 7-(2-aminopyrimidin-5-yl)-1-{[(1R)-1-cyclopropyl-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl]amino}-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole-4-carboxamide (65). Compound 65 is a potent, orally active inhibitor of JAK2 with excellent selectivity, PK profile, and in vivo efficacy in animal models.</td>\n",

A new set of general conditions for C-N coupling, developed using a high-throughput experimentation (HTE) technique, enabled a full SAR analysis of the spirohydantoins. This rapid and directed SAR exploration has resulted in the first reported examples of hydantoin derivatives with good PK in preclinical species. Potassium channel off-target activity (hERG) was successfully eliminated through the systematic introduction of acidic functionality to the molecular structure. Undesired upregulation of alanine aminotransferese (ALT) liver enzymes was mitigated and a robust on-/off-target margin was achieved. Spirohydantoins represent a class of highly efficacious, short-acting PHD1-3 inhibitors causing a robust erythropoietin (EPO) upregulation in vivo in multiple preclinical species.

We recently identified pyrimidinetriones (PYTs) as a CaV1.3-selective scaffold; here we report the structure-activity relationship of PYTs with both CaV1.3 and CaV1.2 LTCCs. By variation of the substituents on the cyclopentyl and arylalkyl groups of PYT, SAR studies allowed characterization of the CaV1.3 and CaV1.2 LTCCs binding sites. The SAR also identified four important moieties that either retain selectivity or enhance binding affinity.

Calcium influx through CaV1.3 LTCC during autonomous pacemaking in adult dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta is related to the generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress in animal models. Development of a CaV1.3 antagonist selective over CaV1.2 is essential because CaV1.2 pore-forming subunits are the predominant form of LTCCs and are abundant in the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. We have explored 1,4-dihydropyrimidines and 4H-pyrans to identify potent and selective antagonists of CaV1.3 relative to CaV1.2 LTCCs. A library of 36 dihydropyridine (DHP)-mimic 1,4-dihydropyrimidines and 4H-pyrans was synthesized, and promising chiral compounds were resolved. The antagonism studies of CaV1.3 and CaV1.2 LTCCs using DHP mimic compounds showed that dihydropyrimidines and 4H-pyrans are effective antagonists of DHPs for CaV1.3 LTCCs. Some 1,4-dihydropyrimidines are more selective than isradipine for CaV1.3 over CaV1.2, shown here by both calcium flux and patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments, where the ratio of antagonism is around 2-3. These results support the hypothesis that the modified hydrogen bonding donor/acceptors in DHP-mimic dihydropyrimidines and 4H-pyrans can interact differently with DHP binding sites, but, in addition, the data suggest that the binding sites of DHP in CaV1.3 and CaV1.2 LTCCs are very similar.</td>\n",

In addition, the anilino-thiazole amides displayed good selectivity over other TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPV1, and TRPV4), as well as against cardiac ion channels (CaV1.2, hERG, and NaV1.5). The high oxidation potential of the aliphatic piperidine and aniline groups, as well as the lability of the thiazole amide group contributed to the high clearance observed for this class of compounds. Conversion of an isoquinoline amide to a naphthyridine amide markedly reduced clearance for the bicyclic piperidines, and improved oral bioavailability for this compound series, however TRPC3 and TRPC6 blocking activity was reduced substantially. Although the most potent anilino-thiazole amides ultimately lacked oral exposure in rodents and were not suitable for chronic dosing, analogs such as 14-19, 22, and 23 are potentially valuable in vitro tool compounds for investigating the role of TRPC3 and TRPC6 in cardiovascular disease.</td>\n",

Furthermore, they were able to protect neuroblastoma cells against Ca(2+) overload and oxidative stress models. Their selectivity ratio makes them highly interesting for the treatment of neurological disorders where Ca(2+) dyshomeostasis and high levels of oxidative stress have been demonstrated. Furthermore, their low potency toward the cardiovascular channel subtype makes them safer by reducing their probable side effects, in comparison to classical 1,4-dihydropyridines. Some compounds afforded good protective profile in a postincubation model that simulates the real clinical situation of ictus patients, offering a therapeutic window of opportunity of great interest for patient recovery after a brain ischemic episode.
